    <h1> Work done</h1>

    <h2>
•	In everyday life work is said to be done every time there is some effort included. For example if you are pushing against the wall, in everyday language it is said that you did some work, but in physics unless you have moved an object, you did not do any work. <br>

•	Work done on an object is defined as the product of the magnitude of the force acting on the body and the displacement in the direction of the force.<br>
•	Work done =   displacement <br>
•	W =  s <br>
•	Work has only magnitude and no direction <br>
•	The unit of work is newton metre (N m) or joule (J). <br>
•	If a force acting on a body causes no displacement, the work done is 0. For example, pushing a wall. <br>

<h1>Energy</h1>

<h2>
•	Energy is defined as the ability to do work. Its unit is the same as that of work. <br>
•	SI unit of energy or work = Joule (Nm) or Kgm2s−2. <br>
•	Energy has different forms: Light, heat, chemical, electrical or mechanical. <br>
•	Mechanical energy is the sum of: <br>
     (i) Kinetic energy (K.E)   <br>
     (ii) Potential energy (P.E)<br>
•	Mechanical energy = Kinetic energy + Potential energy<br>
</h2>


<h1>Kinetic Energy</h1>

<h2>
•	Objects in motion possess energy and can do work. This energy is called Kinetic Energy.<br>
•	F = ma<br>
•	Also W = F.s<br>
•	 From the 2nd equation of motion v2 - u2 = 2as<br>
•	 we get ⇒ s = v2 – u2 / 2a       Substituting equation for work done by a moving body,<br>
•	we get W = ma *  v2 – u2 / 2a<br>
•	When two identical bodies are in motion, the body with a higher velocity has more K.E.<br>

<h1>Work Energy Theorem</h1>

<h2>
    •	The work-energy theorem states that the net work done by a moving body can be calculated by finding the change in KE.<br>
•	⇒Work done = Final Kinetic Energy – Initial Kinetic Energy<br>
•	 W = 1/2 m *v square - 1/2m*u square<br>

    <h1>Exercise-11.1 Page: 148</h1>

    <h2>
1. A force of 7 N acts on an object. The displacement is, say 8 m, in the direction of the force. Let us take it that the force acts on the object through the displacement. What is the work done in this case?

Solution:
When a force F acts on an object to move it in its direction through a distance S, the work is done<br>
The work on the body is done by force<br>
Work done = Force × Displacement<br>
W = F × S<br>	
Where,<br>
F = 7 N S = 8 m<br><br>
So, work done,<br>
W = 7 × 8<br>
W = 56 Nm<br>
W = 56 J<br>
    </h2>

    <h1>Exercise-11.2 Page: 149</h1>

    <h2>
1. When do we say that work is done?

Solution:
Work is completed whenever the given conditions are satisfied:<br>
(i) A force acts on the body.<br>
(ii) There’s a displacement of the body caused by the applied force on the direction of the applied force.<br>
</h2>

<h2>
    2. Write an expression for the work done when a force is acting on an object in the direction of its displacement.
    Solution:
    When a force F displaces a body through a distance S within the direction of the applied force, then the work done W on the body is given by the expression:<br>
    W = F × S
    </h2>

    <h1>Exercise-11.3 Page: 152</h1>

    <h2>
 1. What is the kinetic energy of an object?<br>
Solution:<br>
The energy possessed by a body by the virtue of its motion is termed mechanical energy or kinetic energy. Every moving object possesses mechanical energy. A body uses mechanical energy to try to work. Kinetic energy of the hammer is employed in driving a nail into a log of wood, mechanical energy of air is employed to run wind mills, etc.<br>
</h2>

<h2>
2. Write an expression for the kinetic energy of an object.<br>
Solution:<br>
If a body of mass m is moving with a speed v, then its K.E. Ek is given by the expression,<br>
Ek = 1/2 m v2<br>
Its SI unit is Joule (J).<br>
</h2>

<h2>
3. The kinetic energy of an object of mass, m moving with a velocity of 5 ms-1 is 25 J. What will be its kinetic energy when its velocity is doubled? What will be its kinetic energy when its velocity is increased three times?<br>
Solution:<br>
We know that K.E<br>

= 1/2 m v2<br>

⇒ K.E = 1/2 m v2<br>

⇒ 25 = 1/2 m 5 square<br>

⇒ m = 2 kg<br>

1st Case<br>

If velocity is doubled<br>

then,<br>

velocity of the object = 10 m/s<br>

mass os the object = 2 kg<br>

⇒ K.E = 1/2 m v2<br>

⇒ K.E =  2 × 10²<br>

⇒ K.E = 100 joule.<br>

2nd Case<br>

If velocity is three times<br>

Then,<br>

velocity of the object = 15 m/s<br>

mass os the object = 2 kg<br>

⇒ K.E = 1/2 m v2<br>

⇒ K.E =  2 × 15²<br>

⇒ K.E = 225 joule.<br>

    <h1>Potential energy</h1>

    <h2>
•	Energy can get stored in an object when work is done on it. For example, stretching a rubber string.
•	The energy that is possessed by a body by virtue of its configuration or change in position is known as Potential Energy.
</h2>

<h1> Potential energy of an object at a height</h1>

<h2>
•	When an object is raised to a certain height, work is done against gravity to change its position. This energy is stored as Potential Energy. <br>
•	W = F.s <br>
•	F = ma<br>
In the case of increasing the height, F = mg<br>
∴ W (P.E) = mgh<br>

<h1> Law of conservation of energy</h1>

<h2>
•	Law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but can be transferred from one form to another. The total energy before and after the transformation remains constant. <br>
•	Total energy = KE + PE <br>
•	For example, consider a ball falling freely from a height. At height h, it has only PE = mgh. By the time it is about to hit the ground it has a velocity and therefore has KE=12mv2. Therefore, energy gets transferred from PE to KE, while the total energy remains same. <br>

<h1> POWER</h1>

<h2>
•	The rate of doing work or the rate of transfer of energy is called power. <br>
   P=Wt  <br>
•	SI unit is Watt (Js−1).<br>
•	Average power =total energy consumed / total time taken <br>
•	The commercial unit of power is kWh i.e. energy used in 1 hour at 1000 Joules/second. <br>
  1kWh=3.6×106J <br>

<h1>Exercise-11.4 Page: 156</h1>

<h2>
    Exercise-11.4 Page: 156  <br>
    	Solution:    <br>
    	Power is that the rate of doing work or the speed of transfer of energy. If W is that the quantity of work wiped out time t, then power is given by the expression, <br>
    	P = W/T <br>
    	It is expressed in watt (W). <br>



	2. Define 1 watt of power.  <br>
	Solution: <br>
	A body is claimed to possess power of one watt if it will work on the speed of 1 joule in 1 s.  <br>
	That is,  <br>
	One W = 1 J/1 S   <br>


	3. A lamp consumes 1000 J of electrical energy in 10 s. What is its power?  <br>
	Solution: <br>
	Power = Work/Time<br>
	P = W/T<br>
	Time = 10 s <br>
	Work done = Energy consumed by the lamp = 1000 J <br>
	Power = 1000/10 = 100 Js-1 =100 W <br>


	4. Define average power <br>
	Solution: <br>
	The average Power of an agent could also be outlined because the total work done by it within the total time taken. <br>

   Average Work Done =   Total Work Done/Total Time Taken  <br>
